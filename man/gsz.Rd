The authors revisit Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti (1992)â€™s celebrated conjecture that Italian cities that achieved self-government in the Middle Ages have higher modern-day levels of social capital. More specifically, they study the effects of free city-state status on social capital as measured by the number of nonprofit organizations and organ donations per capita, and a measure of whether students cheat in mathematics. We focus on the first outcome, the number of nonprofit organizations.
